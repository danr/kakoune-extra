lineindent.kak
==============

This script provides a way to indent a selection in relation with a
remote line, be it using a relative index or an absolute line number.

lineindent
~~~~~~~~~~

A single argument is expected by the `lineindent` function, which can
take one of the following forms:

- an integer, which indicates the number of the reference line, e.g. `3`
- a plus sign `+` followed by an integer, which points to a specific
  line beneath the current selection, e.g. `+2`
- a negative integer, which points to a specific line above the current
  selection, e.g. `-2`

Once the modifier has been passed, it will be used to pinpoint the
reference line, and all the lines within the current selection will be
aligned with it.

Example: indenting lines in a list (the last two lines are selected)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- this is the first item of a list
  this line was manually indented to match the first item's indentation
this line was typed after that and is part of the current selection
and so is this one

:lineindent -1<ret>

- this is the first item of a list
  this line was manually indented to match the first item's indentation
  this line was typed after that and is part of the current selection
  and so is this one
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
