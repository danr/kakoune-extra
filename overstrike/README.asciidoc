overstrike.asciidoc
===================

This module allows overstrike formatted contents to be rendered by Kakoune in a buffer.

The following environment variables will be parsed and translated into faces at parsing time:

* `LESS_TERMCAP_md`: capacity used by the `less` pager to render bold text
* `LESS_TERMCAP_us`: capacity used by the `less` pager to render underlined text

If those variables are not exported in the environment, regular bold and underline effects will be used instead.

Accentuated characters using an overstrike sequence are not supported.

Commands
--------

overstrike-parse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parse the current buffer and apply a highlighter to the current window that applies the `OverstrikeBold` and
`OverstrikeUnderline` faces to the overstriken text.

Note that this function isn't suited to convert big documents (> 1000 lines) at the time of writing. For reference,
it takes a solid minute to render `bash`'s manpage, and around 5 minutes to render `gcc`'s.
