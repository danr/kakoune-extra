idsession.asciidoc
==================

Kakoune assigns the process ID of the server as session name, which
makes it moderatly difficult to make a difference from several active sessions on the session.
This script automatically renames the current session with a more human friendly format: an adjective and a name.

The adjective and the name are selected pseudo-randomly, which should avoid collisions, but not
necessarily guarantee they won't happen.
