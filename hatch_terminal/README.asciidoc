hatch_terminal.asciidoc
=======================

This script allows spawning a shell or an arbitrary command in a new window, exporting information about the current session in the environment.

Commands
--------

The following commands are specialized implementations that all follow the same prototype. They all take an optional argument, a shell command
that will be run in the newly created window. If no command is passed, a shell is spawned.

The environment of the newly created window will contain the following environment variables:

* `KAK_SESSION`: name of the parent session that spawned the window
* `KAK_CLIENT`: name of the parent client that spawned the window

hatch-terminal-x11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementation used when no multiplexer is detected and the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not empty. A new terminal is spawned using the `termcmd` option.

hatch-terminal-tmux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementation used when the `$TMUX` environment variable is not empty, creates an horizontal split by default.

hatch-terminal-dvtm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementation used when the `$DVTM` environment variable is not empty.

Aliases
-------

hatch-terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `hatch-terminal` alias is automatically set to one of the commands defined by the script, according to the environment in which the session is set.
